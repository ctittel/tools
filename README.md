Tools that might be useful for my workflow.

## Tools
- `ct-rga-fzf`: Fuzzy fulltext search in all files in the current directory and all subdirectories
    - the selected file will be opened
    - if no file was selected in the `fzf` prompt, the user will be asked for a filename and that file will be created & opened instead
    - Requirements: [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [`ripgrep-all` (`rga`)](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all)
